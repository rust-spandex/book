# Introduction

Welcome to the SpanDeX book. This book serves as a tutorial for SpanDeX.

## What is SpanDeX?

SpanDeX is a modern alternative to LaTeX, carefully designed to be:
  - **ultra performant**, allowing lightning fast compilation and
  hot reloading with optimized algorithms;
  - **simple**, avoiding the need for users to learn a complex
  language before being able to do basic things;
  - **easy to debug**, not reproducing the tons of useless stuff LaTeX vomits
  every time something goes wrong and making it a breeze to find and fix simple
  mistakes.

## WIP

This project is still very recent, and very (very) few functionnalities are
supported. This is not production ready in any way, it's simply here if you
want to have fun and play around.

## API documentation

The API documentation is available [here](/spandex).

## Source code

The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/tforgione/spandex).
