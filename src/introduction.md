# Introduction

Welcome to the SpanDeX's book. This book serves as a tutorial for SpanDeX.

## What is SpanDeX?

SpanDeX is a modern alternative to LaTeX, with the following goals:
  - **performance**, as always in a rust project
  - **simplicity**, we would like to avoid forcing people to learn a complex
    language before being able to do basic things
  - **easy debugging**, one of the main problems of LaTeX according to us is
    that it prints so many stuff on the console that it is pretty much useless
    and it's often really painful to find a simple mistake

## WIP

This project is still really recent, and very (very) few functionnalities are
supported. This is not production ready in any way, it's simply here if you
want to have fun and try things.

## Source code
